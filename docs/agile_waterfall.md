## During the MSIS program

During your time in the MSIS program you will be required to partake in simulations and group projects that will take advantage of both agile and waterfall. As a result, it is expected that you will enter the program with a knowledge of these two methodologies. They are meant to aid teams throughout the development lifecycle on projects surrounding technology. However, as time has gone on, various other industries have begun to adopt these very methodologies to assist with their projects.

If you have yet to read up on these two methodologies please navigate to their respective pages:
*  [Agile](/agile)
*  [Waterfall](/waterfall)

## Major concepts

**You should be able to leverage your knowledge of both agile and waterfall in order to make informed project planning decisions** that will benefit you throughout your studies and career.

1. Recognize the _**key components**_ related to the two methodologies.
2. Understand the _**advantages**_ and _**disadvantages**_ associated with each methodology
3. Be able to _**determine which methodology**_ will best serve an outlined project.

## Resources

## Practice

Below you will find an assortment short answer questions relating to both agile and waterfall. These are meant to test your knowledge regarding the previously outlined material.
