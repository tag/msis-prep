# Preparing for the MSIS program

This site provides resources to help you prepare for entrance into the Masters of Information Systems (MSIS) graduate program. The topics presented here should be a review of prerequisite content you completed during your undergraduate degree. We have compiled these resources to help you shore up your understanding of these topics.

All content here is self-paced. As with any work, the more effort you put in, the greater your rewards will be. Our program has a high standard of excellence. We will provide you with the tools you need to succeed, but how well you prepare is up to you.

## Prerequisite knowledge

You should have a general knowledge of information systems, as might be covered in any introductory course. The open textbook [_Information Systems for Business and Beyond (2019)_][open-is-text][^open-txt-fn] has a good high-level overview. The entire text is worth reading, but if you have limited time, focus your attention on the first five chapters.
