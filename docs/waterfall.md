## During the MSIS program

As part of your study of managing successful IT initiatives, you will be required to learn both agile and waterfall, two methodologies that are used across development lifecycles. There are advantages and disadvantages to each, and you will learn the contexts best suited for each. On this page, we will focus primarily on waterfall, its concepts and main uses. This site has a companion [page that introduces agile](agile), and materials that [compare and contrast waterfall and agile](agile_waterfall).

## Major concepts

You should have a basic understanding of the waterfall development methodology, and understand when it is best to apply it over other potential development methodologies.

1. Understand the history of the _**waterfall**_ approach to development.
2. Explain the _**phases**_ of waterfall.
3. Understand the contexts where waterfall might be preferred to agile.
4. Be able to determine the best methodology for a given project.

_Disclaimer: There is occasionally disagreement as to "proper" number of phases in waterfall. We will describe it as having seven phases, some sources use a different number. This is a result of phases being combined. No matter the number of phases used by a given source, the principles are the same._

*[SDLC]: Software Development Life Cycle

## Phases of Waterfall

In theory, waterfall development moves forward phase by phase, and never backward. (This is not always true in practice.)  This methodology is an excellent fit when the cost of construction is very high compared with analysis and design, and for highly regulated projects, where the cost of failed tests is particularly high.

1. _**Planning:**_ Focuses on determining project goals and crafting a high-level plan for the intended project. Planning should specify project scope boundaries, and specifically state which items are not in project scope. Estimates developed during this critical phase may lack specificity, and will be revised with greater confidence over the next two stages. This stage represents a critical decision point for management as they decide whether to pursue a project.
2. _**Analysis:**_ This phase analyzes end user requirements and project goals and converts them into project requirements. Requirements gathering and elicitation should deeply investigate the needs of users across the organization.
3. _**Design:**_ In this phase, requirements are organized and development is planned, but not started. Comparable to an architect's blueprints before construction occurs. The technical capabilities necessary for development and delivery are examined.
4. _**Construction/Build:**_ Involves the main build-out of the desired solution, this phase tends to be code heavy and aims to meet the requirements set fourth throughout the previous three phases.  
5. _**Testing:**_ Occurs once  main software development has concluded; issues may arise causing you to revert to the previous phase.
6. _**Implementation/Deployment:**_ Product development has concluded and the final deliverable will now be put into use throughout an organization. This signals the move to post-development support.
7. _**Maintenance/Support:**_ Occurs once the final product has been delivered and is actively being used within an organization. _When_, not if, issues arise, your team must be ready to respond and update the software to address those issues. On occasion issues may require you to roll back the product version to a previously stable version.

### Primary advantages of waterfall

1. Working software is not produced until late during the SDLC. Waterfall is designed so that businesses can make "go/no-go" decisions after each phase. It is easy to stop work on a project still in the design phase. If construction and testing have a significantly higher cost than analysis and design
1. Simple, easy to utilize on small projects
2. Centralized, great for communication throughout the SDLC. The phases are very helpful for planning project staffing requirements, as different capabilities are required at each phase.
3. Easily managed, easily understood. Experience suggests the waterfall-style SDLC is most easily understood by those outside of IT.
4. Defined end goal throughout project duration. Each phase has specific goals and deliverables that can be applied to all projects.

### Primary disadvantages of waterfall

1. Working software is not produced until late during the SDLC. Waterfall is not a good fit for situations where a partial solution would be better than no output.
2. Waterfall may be poorly suited for large, complex projects. A better approach, if possible, is several smaller projects. Large projects can lead to breakdowns in communication. Research tells us that most project failures are caused by mistakes in the analysis and design phases. Requirements might be undocumented or misunderstood. In large projects, the end users, the staff writing requirements, and the developers may work on different teams, and only interact through project documentation. This may lead to miscommunications.
3. Lack of performance measuring techniques. Unlike agile methodologies, which have regular "sprints" and status meetings, performance monitoring in waterfall is designed to occur at the end of phases rather than at regular time intervals.
4. Difficult to accommodate changing requirements during SDLC. Sometimes requirements change, either due to outside forces or a better understanding of the problem. The phased nature of waterfall makes it difficult to "back up" and re-do previous phases when requirements change. Because requirements change is usually seen as a high-risk activity, organizations typically have a formal process for project changes.
5. Big-bang Deployment; may lead to extensive deployment problems (High Risk)
