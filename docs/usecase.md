## During the MSIS program

During your time in the MSIS program you will be required to model processes using <abbr title = "Business Process Model and Notation"> BPMN </abbr>, primarily in the <abbr title = "Agile, Processes, and Automation"> APA </abbr> module. However, it is important that you understand general modeling techniques that may aid you throughout the program on various assignments and group projects. For this reason, we expect that you have experience with <abbr title = "Unified Modeling Language"> UML </abbr> and creating Use Case Diagrams.

You are encouraged to practice with Microsoft Visio as this is primarily used throughout the program. However, below are a few other options which will be sufficient.

## Major concepts

**You should be able to identify actors, use cases, and relationships** for use within use case diagrams.

1. Explain what an _**actor**_ is and be able to identify a set of actors within an outlined case or business process.
2. You ought to be able to extract multiple _**use cases**_ while effectively turning them into tasks. after reading through a case or business process.
3. Identify _**relationships**_ between actors and specific tasks and understand the four different types of relationships.
    1. Understand when to utilize a  _**association**_ relationship
    2. Understand when to utilize a  _**generalization**_ relationship
    3. Understand the differences between an _**include**_ and  _**extend**_ as well as when to use either relationship.

## Resources

There are plenty of great resources out there for learning how to effectively utilize _**use case diagrams**_ when representing the interaction between an actor/user and various use cases/tasks in a system. We have highlighted below a variety of these resources to assist you in understanding the basics of use case diagrams as well as providing a simple refresher.

*  [What is a Use Case Diagram?][visual-link][^citation-one] This article serves as a good overview of use case diagrams by offering insight into their components and how to _**identify use cases**_ and the _**associated actors.**_

## Practice

Below you will find a condensed list of walkthroughs and practice exercises pertaining to Use Case Diagrams that may be helpful in ensuring you have an understanding on the topic.


*  **Bank ATM UML Use Case Diagrams Examples:** "Customer uses a bank ATM to check balances of his/her bank accounts, deposit funds, withdraw cash and/or transfer funds (use cases). ATM Technician provides maintenance and repairs to the ATM." [Answer Provided][use-case-practice] [^citation-eight]

*  **Point of sales (POS) terminal:** "Checkout use case involves Customer, Clerk and Credit Payment Service actors and includes scanning items, calculating total and taxes, and payment use cases. This is an example of a large and complex use case split into several smaller use cases." [Answer Provided][use-case-practice] [^citation-eight]

*  **e-Library online public access catalog (OPAC):** "Patrons of a library can search library catalog online to locate various resources - books, periodicals, audio and visual materials, or other items under control of the library.

*  **Credit card processing system:** "The merchant submits a credit card transaction request to the credit card payment gateway on behalf of a customer. Bank which issued customer's credit card is actor which could approve or reject the transaction. If transaction is approved, funds will be transferred to merchant's bank account." [Answer Provided][use-case-practice] [^citation-eight]
