## During the MSIS program

During your time in the MSIS program you will be required to model processes using <abbr title = "Business Process Model and Notation"> BPMN </abbr>. It is important that you understand general modeling techniques that may aid you throughout the program on various assignments and group projects. For this reason, we expect that you have experience with <abbr title = "Unified Modeling Language"> UML </abbr> and creating Use Case Diagrams.

You are encouraged to practice with Microsoft Visio as this is primarily used throughout the program. However, below are a few other options which will be sufficient.

## Major concepts

**You should be able to identify actors, use cases, and relationships** for use within use case diagrams.

1. Explain what an _**actor**_ is and be able to identify a set of actors within an outlined case or business process.
2. You ought to be able to extract multiple _**use cases**_ while effectively turning them into tasks. after reading through a case or business process.
3. Identify _**relationships**_ between actors and specific tasks and understand the four different types of relationships.
    1. Understand when to utilize a  _**association**_ relationship
    2. Understand when to utilize a  _**generalization**_ relationship
    3. Understand the differences between an _**include**_ and  _**extend**_ as well as when to use either relationship.

## Resources

There are plenty of resources online for learning how to effectively utilize _**use case diagrams**_ when representing the interaction between an actor/user and various use cases/tasks in a system. Highlighted below are a variety of resources to assist you in understanding the basics of use case diagrams.

*  First, you may find it helpful to read a brief overview of Use Case Diagrams. The following article, [What is a Use Case Diagram?][visual-link][^citation-one], offers that as well as insight into how to _**identify use cases**_ and the _**associated actors.**_

*  The following slide deck, [Use Case Diagrams - In-depth][courses-cs][^citation-two], builds upon the previously outlined material. Additionally, it touches on  _**setting up relationships**_ as well as the _**benefits**_ whcih come from using use case diagrams.

*  Next, be sure to read [Constructing Use Case Diagrams][sourcemaking][^citation-three], this resource is focused on _**constructing**_ Use Case Diagrams by bringing together previously mentioned concepts such as _**identifying _actors**_ and establishing _**relationships**_

*  The following slide deck, [Use Case Diagrams - PowerPoint & Examples][csis-pace][^citation-four], gives a detailed outline regarding _**actors**_, _**use cases**_, and general best practices. It is meant to aid you in understanding the concept.

*  Lastly, if you still feel uncertain regarding _**actors**_ and _**use cases**_, check out the following article, [Use Case Diagrams - Tutorial w/ Example][guru99][^citation-five]. It continues to reiterate previously outlined content, while providing an example to assist you in understanding the concept.

*  You may find it useful to watch [Use Case Diagrams - Tutorial/Walkthrough][youtube-one][^citation-six]; this video provides a step-by-step walkthrough for you while reiterating both _**actors**_ and _**relationships.**_ [![Use Case Walkthrough](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zid-MVo7M-E/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zid-MVo7M-E)
