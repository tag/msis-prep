## The Business Activities Cycles



> Prof. Joshua Dennis from Indiana University Bloomington: "The business cycles begin with capturing data/information about a transaction. They end with information output, such as a financial statement or payment (similar to a system). Similar transactions are grouped together to form a business cycles...."Business Cycles give us a framework for gathering and documenting business requirements or “business rules"

There are 5 major Business Cycles:

1. **Procurement cycle (Expense, Purchasing, Procure to Pay)**
2. **Revenue cycle (Sales, Order to Cash)**
3. **Production cycle (Manufacturing or Operations)**
4. **Human Resources / Payroll cycle**
5. **Accounting Cycle**

During the CORE, you would participate in different business activities of these cycles using SAP. Here, I would focus on introducing the **Procurement Cycle** and the **Revenue Cycle**. There are a lot of good resources online that you could find about other three cycles. You are very welcome to dig into them as knowing them would help you better understand business processes in organizations.

- ### Procurement Cycle (Procure-to-Pay)

Read about the Procurement Cycle: 

[*Procurement Cycle (The Telegraph)*](https://jobs.telegraph.co.uk/article/procurement-cycle/ )

From [the Telegraph article](https://jobs.telegraph.co.uk/article/procurement-cycle/ ) above, you could find that there are many important documents that are involved in the procurement cycle. You would find it helpful in the future if you could gain a basic understanding of them right now. They are:

1. Purchase Order: prepared by the **buyer** when ordering goods or services
2. Goods Receipt: prepared by the **buyer** when taking physical possession of goods
3. Invoice / Bill: prepared by the **seller** and sent to the **buyer**
4. Check (Payment): Prepared by the **buyer** and given to the **seller**, usually accompanied by a remittance advice to seller knows where to apply the payment

*Note: You are encouraged to look online for examples of the above documents if you don't know what they might look like.*

- ### Sales Cycle (Order-to-Cash)

The sales cycle is the process occurred when companies are selling products to customers. It starts from receiving the purchase order from the buyers, and it ends until the accounting department has closed the transaction.

Below are two more detailed websites explaining the stages and documents that are involved. Pay attention again to each step as they would generate documents that are essential for firms:

*[Step by Step: What you Should Know About the Order-to-Cash Process (Salesforce)](https://www.salesforce.com/products/cpq/resources/what-to-know-about-order-to-cash-process/)* 

[*A Walk Through The Order To Cash (O2C) Cycle*](https://www.purchasecontrol.com/blog/order-to-cash-process/) from PurchaseControl. PurchaseControl created a SaaS-based cloud spend management system for many businesses to help with controls over their financial operations.

The documents that are generated from the sales cycle are:

1. Sales Order: typically a reflection of (and response to) the Purchase Order on the **Seller** side when **Buyer** sends over a purchase order.
2. Packing Slip: Prepared by the **Seller** and transfer internally accompanies the goods and usually omits $ dollar amount as an internal control measure *(pause a second to think here: why does packing slip omit the dollar amount? Do some research!)*
3. Invoice (Bill): Prepared by the **Seller** and sent to the **Buyer**
4. Payment Receipt: produced by the **Seller** upon receiving payment from **Buyer** and/or may be reported on a monthly statement of account.

*Note: You are encouraged to look online for examples of the above documents if you don't know what they might look like.*

### Other Business Activities Cycles

There are five business activities cycles that you should understand before entering MSIS program.
>1. Procurement cycle (Expense, Purchasing, Procure to Pay)
>2. Revenue cycle (Sales, Order to Cash)
>3. Production cycle (Manufacturing or Operations)
>4. Human Resources / Payroll cycle
>5. Accounting Cycle
In this page, we have summarized the first two cycles. However, you should read about the other three cycles as you would be doing hands-on practices, labs, and simulation games for the ERP module of MSIS Core.

Refer to these great articles to get familiar with the business cycles that are not described in detail, try to think about how these business activities connect to each other inside an enterprise:

#### Production Cycle:

[*Step by Step: What you Should Know About the Order-to-Cash Process* (Salesforce)](https://help.ordertime.com/help/production-cycle) 

We recommend you to watch the below video (of 3:03 length) created by THE BEAN COUNTERS' LAB. THE BEAN COUNTERS' LAB is a group of academics in S. Africa and they produce contents on auditing, governance, financing and management accounting for students.

##### MRP (Material Requirements Planning) 

This Video (of 3:56 length) created by Edspira does an excellent job on teaching the concepts of MRP. Edspira is a Youtube channel created by Michael McLaughlin, PhD, CPA. His mission of creating Edspria is to provide a world-class business education for free.

#### Human Resources Cycle

Skim this article, *[Human Resources Cycle: Comparison of models](https://www.oxford-review.com/oxford-review-encyclopaedia-terms/human-resources-cycle/)*, should give you a fairly good idea on how HR cycles could be. We will not dig deeply in the HR cycle, but it is smart for you as a future business leader to learn about it.

##### Accounting Cycle

Carefully read [*Accounting Cycle*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-cycle.asp) on Investopedia, don't forget to watch their embedded video as it would thoroughly walk you through the Accounting Cycle.





## Exercise

###### 1. Jot down every document from the Sales and Procurement cycle.

(It would be necessary for you to remember them all. Knowing them will definitely serve you well in MRP module of MSIS Core! )



###### 2. In your own words, try to explain why there's no dollar amount on packing slips?



###### 3. Read A real SAP case

 [*From order-to-cash to wall-to-wall: Four SAP implementations at Smithfield Foods"*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2043886918819302)[^3]

Try to make sense of this case, and tackle these case questions. It is challenging, but challenges are helpful. In MSIS Core, you are expected to read and understand business cases like this and do many exercises with them.

1. What were the driving factors for each implementation? In which instances did the company’s business environment force the need for an ERP system? When was the change implemented as part of the corporate strategy? Which do you think played a larger role in this process? Why?
2. For each SAP implementation, list pros and cons. As the VP of IT what would you have done differently to help reduce the complexity and speed up the process of these changes?
3. For the full-scale implementation, what role did each governance committee play in the process? Was there a need for two committees? What would be the pros and cons of using a single committee to arbitrate unification issues?
