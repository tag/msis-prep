## During the MSIS program

During your time in the MSIS program you will partake in various business activities which make up the business cycles found in SAP. It is key that you understand how these activities work into the cycles so that you can better understand how <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> platforms function.

If you have yet to explore the [ERP module, please click here](/ERP).

### Major concepts

1. Define _**business cycles**_; list the five major business cycles and explain their significance within a business
2. Describe the _**Purchase and Revenue cycles**_ in detail
3. _**Understand the document flow**_ for the Purchase and Revenue cycles
4. Understand the _**Production, HR, and Accounting cycles**_

## What is a Business Cycle?

> Prof. Joshua Dennis from Indiana University Bloomington: "The business cycles begin with capturing data/information about a transaction. They end with information output, such as a financial statement or payment (similar to a system). Similar transactions are grouped together to form a business cycles...."Business Cycles give us a framework for gathering and documenting business requirements or “business rules" There are 5 major Business Cycles:

1. Procurement cycle (also called Expense, Purchasing, Procure-to-Pay)
2. Revenue cycle (also called Sales, Order-to-Cash)
3. Production cycle (also called Manufacturing or Operations)
4. Human Resources (sometimes called hire-to-fire) / Payroll cycle
5. Accounting Cycle

## Resources

### Procurement Cycle (Procure-to-Pay)

Read about the Procurement Cycle:

*  ["Procurement Cycle"](https://jobs.telegraph.co.uk/article/procurement-cycle/ ), _The Telegraph_
*  ["Procurement Management Process - The 2020 Guide"](https://kissflow.com/procurement-process/)

After reading the above articles, you should find that there are many important documents within the Procurement Cycle; it would be most beneficial if you are able to understand those documents and how they are used within an organization. Those documents are as follows:

1. **Purchase Order**: Prepared by the **Buyer** when ordering goods or services
2. **Goods Receipt**: Prepared by the **Buyer** when taking physical possession of goods
3. **Invoice / Bill**: Prepared by the **Seller** and then sent to the **Buyer**
4. **Check (Payment)**: Prepared by the **Buyer** and given to the **Seller**, usually accompanied by a remittance advice to seller knows where to apply the payment

*Note: You are encouraged to look online for further examples of the above documents*

### Sales Cycle (Order-to-Cash)

The sales cycle is the process occurred as companies sell products to consumers. It begins when a Purchase Order (P.O.) is received from the Buyers, and it ends once the Accounting Dept. has closed the transaction.

Below are two detailed resources explaining the stages and documents involved; It is important that you pay attention to each step as they generate documents which are essential for an organization:

*  *[Step by Step: What you Should Know About the Order-to-Cash Process (Salesforce)](https://www.salesforce.com/products/cpq/resources/what-to-know-about-order-to-cash-process/)*
*  [*A Walk Through The Order To Cash (O2C) Cycle*](https://www.purchasecontrol.com/blog/order-to-cash-process/) by PurchaseControl. PurchaseControl created a SaaS-based Cloud Spend Management System to assist organizations with controls over their financial operations.

The following documents are generated within the sales cycle:

1. **Sales Order**: Typically a reflection of (and response to) the Purchase Order on the **Seller** side when **Buyer** sends over a purchase order.
2. **Packing Slip**: Prepared by the **Seller** and internally accompanies the goods and usually omits dollar amount as an internal control measure *(pause a second to think here: why does packing slip omit the dollar amount? Do some research!)*
3. **Invoice (Bill)**: Prepared by the **Seller** and sent to the **Buyer**
4. **Payment Receipt**: Produced by the **Seller** upon receiving payment from **Buyer** and/or may be reported on a monthly statement of account.

*Note: You are encouraged to look online for examples of the above documents*

### Other Business Activities Cycles

There are five business activity cycles that we recommend knowing as you move into the MSIS Core:

>1. Procurement cycle (Expense, Purchasing, Procure to Pay)
>2. Revenue cycle (Sales, Order to Cash)
>3. Production cycle (Manufacturing or Operations)
>4. Human Resources / Payroll cycle
>5. Accounting Cycle

In this module, we have summarized the first two cycles, however, you should read about the remaining three cycles as you will participate in hands-on practices, labs, and simulations throughout the Core semester.

The following articles aim to familiarize you with the business cycles not previously outlined. Remember, think about how each business activity connects with one another to make up one or many business cycles within an organization.

#### Production Cycle:

#### MRP (Material Requirements Planning)

*  The following Video (~4 minutes) created by Edspira does an excellent job of covering the concepts of MRP.

#### Human Resources Cycle
Because HR functions are not the primary purpose of ERP implementations, we don't focus our attention on HR cycles. However, if you wish to learn more, the article ["Human Resources Cycle: Comparison of models"](https://www.oxford-review.com/oxford-review-encyclopaedia-terms/human-resources-cycle/) suggests the complexity of HR cycles in industry.

#### Accounting Cycle

*  Take a look at the [*Accounting Cycle*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accounting-cycle.asp) article on Investopedia.

 <!-- TODO: as well as watching the embedded video as it walks you through, in depth, the Accounting Cycle. -->

## Exercises

1. List each document associated with the Sales and Procurement cycles:
2. In your own words, please explain why there is no dollar amount listed on packing slips?
3. Read a real SAP case, ["From order-to-cash to wall-to-wall: Four SAP implementations at Smithfield Foods"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2043886918819302)[^3] After reading the "Simthfield" case, answer the following questions:

    1. What were the driving factors for each implementation? In which instances did the company’s business environment force the need for an ERP system? When was the change implemented as part of the corporate strategy? Which do you think played a larger role in this process? Why?
    2. For each SAP implementation, list pros and cons of the implementation. As the VP of IT what would you have done differently to help reduce the complexity and speed up the process of these changes?
    3. For the full-scale implementation, what role did each governance committee play in the process? Was there a need for two committees? What would be the pros and cons of using a single committee to arbitrate unification issues?
